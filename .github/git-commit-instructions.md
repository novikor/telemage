Avoid overly verbose descriptions or unnecessary details. Use past simple tense.
If possible, start message with a ticket code from the Git branch name.
Example:
if branch name is `T1-onboarding`,
a commit message must begin with `[T1]`.
E.g. `[T1] Added patch to separate street by line break and updated related tests`
